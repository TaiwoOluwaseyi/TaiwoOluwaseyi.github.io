# RiskT - An Automated Lightweight GRC third-party tool
In today’s compliance-driven environment, evaluating the security posture of third-party vendors is no longer optional—it’s essential. Traditional methods like spreadsheets and email threads often lead to delays, inconsistencies, and limited visibility. This tool was developed to streamline the process, improve accuracy, and provide a scalable, repeatable approach to third-party risk assessments

## Project Components

*Stored Vendor Responses:**  This section contains vendor responses collected through structured questionnaires. Each response is mapped to relevant controls and requirements from recognized frameworks such as ISO 27001, NIST, and SOC 2. The responses are stored in a centralized database and used to evaluate risk based on both qualitative (likelihood and impact) and quantitative scoring.
